Description             : One thing that separates the two halves of Final
                          Doom is that TeamTNT composed many original
                          tracks for Evilution, and I think that this added
                          greatly to its originality and charm, even if
                          some of the MIDIs were really short and/or just
                          not that great. So, what if Dario and Milo Casali
                          were musicians themselves, or what if they had
                          other musicians - perhaps even TNT's music team,
                          or even Bobby Prince himself - on board with the
                          project to provide an original soundtrack to the
                          maps of the Plutonia Experiment?
                          
                          This project is the Doomworld community's answer
                          to that.

Build Time              : Development started on 13 March 2013.
Editor(s) used          : Various
May Not Run With...     : Vanilla doom.exe because the music in the WAD is
                          .MID files, not .MUS files (although none of the
                          files come close to the 96kb limit). Works best
                          with PrBoom, MBF and ZDoom.
